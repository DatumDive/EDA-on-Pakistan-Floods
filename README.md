# EDA on Pakistan Floods

## Project Description

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations on the floods in Pakistan. The goal is to extract insights and patterns from the flood data and create meaningful visualizations to better understand the situation. The project involves data scraping, data preprocessing, and data visualization using Python libraries like Selenium matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Approach
### Data Collection
The latest data on the flood situation in Pakistan was collected from multiple sources, including the National Disaster Management Authority ISLAMABAD (NDMA), Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and ICIMOD. The data was collected using web scraping techniques with Python libraries like Selenium.

### Data Preprocessing
The collected data was preprocessed by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a usable format. The data was then cleaned and processed to create visualizations.

### Data Analysis
The data was analyzed using visualizations like bar charts and piecharts. The visualizations were used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. The analysis revealed that the floods in Pakistan have affected millions of people, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes.

## Getting Started

## Results
The key findings of the data analysis show that the floods in Pakistan have caused significant damage and displacement, with over 20 million people affected and more than four million homeless. The analysis also revealed that the floods have caused damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes, with billions of dollars needed for recovery efforts. The visualizations provided insights into the scale and impact of the floods, which can be used to guide relief efforts and policy decisions.
