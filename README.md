# EDA on Pakistan Floods

## Project Description

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations on the floods in Pakistan. The goal is to extract insights and patterns from the flood data and create meaningful visualizations to better understand the situation. The project involves data scraping, data preprocessing, and data visualization using Python libraries like Selenium matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Approach
### Data Collection
The latest data on the flood situation in Pakistan was collected from multiple sources, including the National Disaster Management Authority ISLAMABAD (NDMA), Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and ICIMOD. The data was collected using web scraping techniques with Python libraries like Selenium.

### Data Preprocessing
The collected data was preprocessed by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a usable format. The data was then cleaned and processed to create visualizations.

### Data Analysis
The data was analyzed using visualizations like bar charts and piecharts. The visualizations were used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. The analysis revealed that the floods in Pakistan have affected millions of people, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) here.
</br>
You will also need to have Anaconda on your machine. You can download the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) here.

### Installing
Clone this repository onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/EDA-on-Pakistan-Floods.git
```
Run `scrape.ipynb` for web scraping from all sources and Run `analysis.ipynb` for Data Analysis

## Results
The key findings of the data analysis show that the floods in Pakistan have caused significant damage and displacement, with over 20 million people affected and more than four million homeless. The analysis also revealed that the floods have caused damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and homes, with billions of dollars needed for recovery efforts. The visualizations provided insights into the scale and impact of the floods, which can be used to guide relief efforts and policy decisions.

## What was the main reason behind Pakistan’s Flood?
### More than average rainfall:

![Rainfall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233808302-0355ff0c-e25d-4686-900a-1cc7cc2378f6.png)

We can see that all provinces this year experienced more than 30-year average rainfall,
and this had a significant impact on the whole country where our northern provinces and
southern provinces both experienced the worst flood in history and the main reason for that is
increased rainfall and melting glaciers. Both contributed to the rising water levels in our rivers
thus making a flood.

## What kind of damages did we face during this flood?
### Loss of Life:

![death](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836136-2e2f8c67-33e3-4baf-a24b-b25b573aa856.png)

Due to the severity of this flood, this country unfortunately faced many deaths majority
of them in Sindh, we can see that a big portion of deaths in Sindh is of children, followed by
death of men and then women. Islamabad and GB faced small number of deaths during these
floods.
A total of 1541 people died in which Sindh had 680 deaths while Baluchistan and KP had around
300, Punjab had just over 200, AJ&K had 40 while GB had around 20 and ICT had only 1 death

### Injured People:

![Injured](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836177-739fb29b-346a-4e59-8d59-541e553fb355.png)

We can see that Sindh not only has the highest number of deaths but also the highest
number of injuries and a large portion of it is comprised by children followed by males. Punjab
has the second highest rate of injury just under 4000 with a large portion of it comprised of male
injuries.

### Damage to Infrastructure:

![Roads](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836204-6f242c6f-e828-4f2d-8f25-c723e278562f.png)

Just like deaths and injuries Sindh is the most effected by Flood in terms of Road
Damage too with over 8000 roads being destroyed by flood, this flood had a little impact on
other provinces because Baluchistan, KP and Punjab faced little damage while ICT, GB and AJ&K
had no damage by this flood.

![Bridge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836222-423bfe8c-4b90-4af4-972b-f919cfcd2399.png)

Sindh and KP faced a lot of bridge damage due to this flood with over 100 bridges
destroyed it made mobility harder which means that the relief team had trouble rescuing and
reaching people in affected areas. Balochistan and Punjab faced moderate amount of damage
and ICT and AJ&K faced no damage.

![Livestock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836238-41007946-c0c1-4d1a-b8e6-f1546cd4e9bb.png)

Balochistan was the most effected in terms of livestock with over 250K animals lost due
to flooding following this Punjab and Sindh both had around 200K animals lost due to the flood.
Thankfully there were no animals lost in the northern areas and ICT.

![Houses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836251-19a28981-1342-4cd6-9dfd-91730f5d9a02.png)

Sindh had to face one of the worst infrastructural damages in history of Pakistan as
around a million people had their homes partially destroyed and around 700K people’s homes
were fully destroyed due to the flood. There was very less impact of flood on other provinces as
on average only 15K homes were lost in other provinces

## Production Loss

![Rice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836277-ca58f732-8716-41bf-85bf-57ac608aed0a.png)

Many districts in Sindh had a huge loss of rice production, the aftereffects of something
with this magnitude will send shockwaves to our agriculture exports and local market for years
to come.
As the total loss of rice production is way over a two million metric tones, to fill in the demand
we will have to import this much and this would be something which will negatively impact the
country’s economy

![Cotton](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836294-1e287e0b-ebda-4083-94de-8f8b020304bd.png)

Similarly, we faced a huge loss in our cotton produce this year due to the floods, with
production loss way over a million bales to fill in this demand we will have to not only import
the deficit, but we won’t be able to export enough to keep the economy stable, later this would
play a major role in the decline of our country’s economy.

![Sugercane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836303-2c5545f7-cdf1-4558-b38d-2e0f91ebdc61.png)

Around 50% of the districts producing sugarcane lost over a million metric tones each
that would take the total of production loss around 10 million metric tones only from Sindh as a
country whose backbone is agriculture, we have suffered a great loss we now can’t only export
this but to meet the demand of the local market we would have to import impacting our
economy negatively

## Loss of Land due to flood:
Not only did we face loss of production, but we also faced loss of land, that land was
used by people for commercial activities, residence or even agriculture but that land is still not
available for any of those activities as it is drenched in flood water.

![area_Baloch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836321-42387951-db6c-42ab-a560-2bd14c7d9c1d.png)

Four main districts faced the most loss of land i.e., Jaffarabad, Musakhel, Jhal Masgsi
and Lehri, they had around 1000 km^2 area under flood water while the other districts had little
to no loss of land

![area_KPK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836360-87ccfd3f-b7d5-4421-80aa-015638f522a1.png)

Only Dera Ismail Khan faced a considerable amount of loss of land which is about 1750
km^2 while the other districts faced little to no damage.

![area_Punjab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836374-8434b334-e0be-466f-82eb-ffe35881e866.png)

Majority of the land in Punjab has been affected by Flood water, Rajanpur and Dera
Ghazi Khan were the two districts which were the most effected around 1500 km^2 land is
under flood water.

![area_Sindh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836384-7dd97806-f7ef-4840-b0d7-24eb7afe0c7b.png)

Around 40% of the districts had 2500km^2 of area under flood water the rest of the
districts had moderate land damages.

## What kind of aftereffects can we expect from this flood?
### Mass Migration:
As people living in northern and southern parts are affected by flood meaning that their
houses, and livelihoods being destroyed by flood water they rush to a safer area with their
families and as this flood increases the people will be heading to middle areas of this country
which are still safe from flood water. This will increase the influx of people in only a selected few
areas which would give rise to a lot of problems like overcrowding.

![Balochistan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836411-6450f774-02a5-4e38-91d1-828caa96e517.png)

Jaffarabad and Musakhel were the most effected in Balochistan thus will force people to
migrate to other areas within the province.

![Punjab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836424-21685006-5f53-4588-a82d-5ca797f2db15.png)

Sialkot was the most effected in Punjab and it is likely that people living there will be
forced to migrate to other areas.

![KPK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836445-d7d66112-7a6c-42ca-91be-660a8b65125c.png)

Over 250K people in Dera Ismail Khan were affected by this flood which means that its
likely people would migrate to other areas in this province.

![Sindh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836448-5e86d375-5ba6-47c8-beb3-ab73714b5111.png)

Around 50% of the districts in Sindh were largely affected by this flood which means
that we can except mass migration from this province. The people will likely migrate within the
province to other areas

### Increased Food Prices:

![prices](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836480-c4ab7449-d455-45cb-b3f5-6d865ac35c81.png)

As we have seen before how this country’s produce and land has been badly affected by
this flood it has also had an impact on other food items as we can see that as soon as flood hit
this country there is a rise on essential items in this country. We see that Tomatoes’ price
increased by 50% in a week followed by price increase in other items.

## Flood Relief:

![Relief](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72251313/233836504-732dd25e-8f50-4179-b9c3-eae8d444b645.png)

As we have seen before Sindh had suffered the most in terms of infrastructure, people,
crops and land so it got the most relief to support that, Sindh got over 14 billion PKR while the other
provinces got around 3 billion each as relief.

## Conclusion:
The major reason for this flood was increased rainfall due to climate change, The amount of
rainfall Pakistan faced this year had not been seen for the past 30 years due to this Pakistan is currently
facing floods. The initial damage of this was that many people in lower areas of Pakistan had died or
were injured especially the people in Sindh.
After this the infrastructure like roads, bridges or houses were damaged most of which was experienced
in Sindh then Balochistan faced the most loss in livestock. Crops worth over 15 million tones were lost
this year due to floods in Sindh.
The aftereffects of this flood include diseases, mass migration and inflation in food prices as Pakistan’s
economy benefits from agriculture exports, this year we would see the impact of this flood on our
economy and our local market as we would struggle to fill in the deficit it would take us years to undo
the damage done to our agriculture.
